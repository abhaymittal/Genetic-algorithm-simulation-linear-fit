# Genetic algorithm simulation for a linear fit
### Author: Abhay Mittal

This program simulates a basic genetic algorithm and performs operations of reproduction, crossover and mutation. I developed it as part of my coursework assignment in Soft Computing.
 The concepts and algorithm are from the book __"Fuzzy Logic with Engineering Applications"__ by __Timothy J. Ross__


 Fitness function => y = C1 x + C2


 The parameter set (C1,C2) is encoded in the form of bit strings.
 The values in this program match those of an example present in the book but can be changed.
